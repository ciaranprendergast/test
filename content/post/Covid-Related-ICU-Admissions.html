<h2>Covid-Related ICU Admissions</h2>
<p>The <strong>Intensive Care Units</strong> in Ireland saw peak patient influx in late March - early April, and from late April, the daily percentage increase in ICU admissions has dropped substantially (note: percentages below 0% relate to days where validation of data led to a decrease in the reported overall number of cases admitted to ICU).
