<h2>Progression of the Virus</h2>
<p>As we can see here, the number of diagnosed Covid-19 cases in Ireland has grown exponentially, reaching <strong>25064</strong> on 01-Jun.Â On the brightside, however, we can see that the rate of infection has fallen drastically; as the impact of <em>social distancing</em> translates into each infected person infecting fewer and fewer other people.</p>
