<h2>Breakdown of Ages Affected</h2>
<p>As we can see in the graph below, the most affected group has been the <strong>Over 75s</strong>, while people aged in their early 20s or younger remain the least likely to have contracted the virus. The disproportionatly fewer young people being affected scews the mean somewhat; as we can see when it is adjusted to include only people 15 years old or older. Updated as of 2021-02-10.</p>
